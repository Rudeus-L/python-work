This is the game is Tic-Tac-Toe Game. The game in China is so called '井' JING Game, it is because the shape of the game board is similar to the Chinese character '井'.
The game rule is simple:
Two players use two symbols --"X" and "O" separately. The way to win the game is to make three same symbols stay in one row or column or diagonal. To prevent another player from winning the game, you should try your best to block the way he is going to win while exploring your own way to win. 

Due to the short time of each game, you can play many, many and many times within one short period. I design this game because I clearly remember that during my middle and high school life, every time when the class is over, I will take a pen and only one paper and look for my classmates to play the game. It is always a pretty perfect game to kill time. Easy to start game and easy to play.
